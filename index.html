  <div class="collapsible" id="number-one-albums">
    <button class="collapsible-btn">Browsing Number One Albums by Year Range <span class="arrow">▸</span></button>
    <div class="collapsible-body" hidden>
      <p>Use this tab to browse the owner's top-ranked album for each year within a time period you define. By adjusting the <strong>range slider</strong>, you can expand or narrow the year range, and the <strong>data table</strong> will update to show the number one album for each year in your selected range. This walkthrough will guide you through the <strong>range slider</strong> with an example.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Click the <strong>Number One Albums</strong> tab. You will see a <strong>range slider</strong> and 6 albums in a <strong>data table</strong> like the image below (the range slider is set to start from 1993 to 1998 at the beginning).

        </li>
        <li>Drag your mouse over the right <strong>handle</strong> and slide it to 2010. If done correctly, you will see the last album in the <strong>data table</strong> has the year 2010, as shown below.

    <button class="collapsible-btn">albums_by_band.R — Filtering Albums by Artist <span class="arrow">▸</span></button>
    <div class="collapsible-body" hidden>
      <p>This file powers the Artist's Albums tab by filtering the dataset to a selected artist and returning their ranked albums along with summary statistics. All three functions use the same filtering pattern with dplyr's <code>filter()</code> and <code>select()</code> functions.

      <h4>all_years</h4>
      <p>This variable extracts and sorts every unique year to populate the drop-down menu.</p>
      <h4>year_albums()</h4>
      <p>This function filters the dataset to the selected year's albums and returns a table with the Ranking, Album, and Artist fields sorted by ranking order.</p>

    <div class="collapsible-body" hidden>
      <p>This file defines the server function that connects user input from the UI to the data functions. Each tab follows the same pattern: it takes the user's selection, passes it to the corresponding data function, and renders the result. Modify this file when you want to change how user input is handled or add server logic for a new tab. Below is a list of which data functions each tab calls:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Home: <code>total_album_count()</code>, <code>total_band_count()</code>, <code>most_pop_artist()</code></li>

    <button class="collapsible-btn">Setting Up album-ranking.csv <span class="arrow">▸</span></button>
    <div class="collapsible-body" hidden>
      <p>This is the CSV file that all data aggregation functions operate on. Follow these steps to create or update it with your own album data. Getting this file structured correctly is required before the app will load and display any data.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Open a spreadsheet application such as Excel or Google Sheets and create a new blank file.</li>
        <li>In the first row, enter the following column headers in this exact order:
          <pre><code>Year, Ranking, Album, Artist, Rating, Vinyl, EP, Live</code></pre>
        </li>
        <li>Enter each album as its own row beneath the headers. For the Vinyl, EP, and Live columns, enter <code>TRUE</code> or <code>FALSE</code> in all caps — R reads these as logical values, and lowercase entries will cause filtering errors.</li>
        <li>Save the file as a CSV. In Excel, choose <strong>File &gt; Save As</strong> and select <strong>CSV (Comma delimited)</strong>. In Google Sheets, choose <strong>File &gt; Download &gt; Comma-separated values (.csv)</strong>.</li>
        <li>Name the file <code>album-rankings.csv</code> and place it in the <code>data/</code> folder inside the project directory.</li>
        <li>Open RStudio, set your working directory to the project folder via <strong>Session &gt; Set Working Directory &gt; Choose Directory</strong>, and run the app with <code>shiny::runApp()</code>. If the Home tab displays a total album count and artist count, the file loaded correctly.</li>
      </ol>
      <p class="note">Note: the Artist field must be spelled consistently across all rows. Inconsistent capitalization (e.g., "Radiohead" vs. "radiohead") will cause that artist to appear as multiple separate entries throughout the app.</p>

  <div class="collapsible" id="using-the-functions">
    <button class="collapsible-btn">Calling Functions Directly in RStudio <span class="arrow">▸</span></button>
    <div class="collapsible-body" hidden>
      <p>All data functions can be called directly in the RStudio console without running the full Shiny app. This is useful for testing individual functions, debugging output, or exploring the data outside of the web interface. Follow these steps to source and call any function from the console.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>In the RStudio console, load <code>dplyr</code> and read the dataset:
          <pre><code>library(dplyr)
album_data &lt;- read.csv("data/album-rankings.csv")</code></pre>
        </li>
        <li>Source the file containing the function you want to call:
          <pre><code>source("albums_by_band.R")</code></pre>
        </li>
        <li>Call the function, passing <code>album_data</code> as the first argument. For example:
          <pre><code>albums_by_bands(album_data, "Radiohead")</code></pre>
          A data frame appears in the console with the columns Album, Year, and Rating.
        </li>
        <li>For <code>band_album_comparison_chart()</code>, also load <code>ggplot2</code> before calling:
          <pre><code>library(ggplot2)
source("compare_bands.R")
band_album_comparison_chart(album_data, "Radiohead", "Arcade Fire")</code></pre>
          The chart renders in the RStudio Plots pane.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p class="note">Note: artist name arguments are case-sensitive and must match the dataset exactly. Run <code>unique(album_data$Artist)</code> to see all valid artist names.</p>
